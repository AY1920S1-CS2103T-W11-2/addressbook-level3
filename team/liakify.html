<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For our project for our Software Engineering course, my team comprising 5 students (including myself) was given the codebase for a command line desktop application called Address Book, and we were required to morph this given codebase into an application of our choice. We chose to morph the given application into a group expense management app called SplitWiser. This enhanced application enables people to simplify expense and debt tracking in group activities, so that people will know exactly how much to pay each other at the end of the activity.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I was responsible for writing the expense adding feature. This makes my role particularly crucial as the <code>expense</code> command is most likely the command that a user interacts with the most. The following sections describe my contributions in greater depth, in addition to the documentation that I also added pertaining to the expense feature.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Major enhancement</strong>: Added the ability to add expenses</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>What it does:</strong> The <code>expense</code> command allows the user to add expenses to an activity by first specifying who paid and how much, followed by an optional description of the expense, then optionally listing people who were involved in the expense.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Justification:</strong> This is important as it gives users the necessary precise control over the people required to pay in each expense. In a real-world group activity scenario, it might not be the case that everyone is involved in every part of the activity that involves money. For example, one might go out for a meal with friends but opt out of buying dessert later. Having such flexibility enables the user to manage a wide range of real-world scenarios.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Highlights:</strong> The design of the <code>expense</code> command was particularly tricky due to the limitations of a CLI interface. The tough part was in trying to strike a balance between keeping the command simple enough to use yet provide enough flexibility for the user to specify various possible combinations of expense details. We went through various possible designs for the <code>expense</code> command and took the user experience into consideration for each case, before finally settling on the way the <code>expense</code> command is currently structured.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Minor enhancement</strong>: Updated the <code>edit</code> command to only work when viewing a contact or activity</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>What it does:</strong> The <code>edit</code> command allows the user to modify certain fields of a contact or activity when viewing them. The original Address Book application already had the <code>edit</code> command built in, but its behaviour was modified to suit SplitWiser.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Justification:</strong> In the original Address Book application, the user was allowed to edit various fields by specifying the index of an item in the visible list, then specifying the respective fields to edit and update. However, this structure is not ideal anymore as our list user interface was updated to not show every field, meaning that the user would not be able to see what exactly was being edited. Thus, the decision was made to enable <code>edit</code> only when viewing an item as this reduces the risk of the user making unintentional edits.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Minor enhancement</strong>: Added a backend <code>Context</code> class that allows for various application contexts and contextual behaviour for various commands</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>What it does:</strong> The <code>Context</code> class keeps track of the current application context that the user is in. This <code>Context</code> object gets updated upon the execution of each command where necessary.</p>

<p>Creates a new expense with a list of contacts, an amount and an optional description, and adds it to the currently viewed activity.

It is in fact possible to add an expense where no one else is involved in by specifying that the people involved only include the person who is paying,<br>
e.g. <code>expense p/John Doe e/15 p/John Doe d/Cab</code><br>
This adds an expense of $15 by John Doe called <code>Cab</code> where only John himself is involved, thus no one owes anyone anything. This can be used to add an expense simply for recording purposes if desired, though it is not an intended use case for SplitWiser since there is no debt to calculate and resolve.

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 1</strong>: An expense is represented by a paying person and an amount. Everyone in the activity is then taken to owe the paying person an equal portion of the paid amount.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Extremely simple to use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Overly idealised and simplified and assumes that everyone is involved in every expense. This severely hinders its utility in real scenarios as this is unable to account for even simple deviations in debt patterns.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 2 (current choice)</strong>: An expense is represented by a paying person, amount, and a list of people involved. Everyone who is specified to be involved then owes an equal portion of the paid amount to the paying person.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Reasonable flexibility as it enables a wide range of possible expense sharing combinations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Forces equal split among participants in the involved list, which is still going to result in limited utility in some real scenarios. A simple example would be that a group of people can have a meal together but each person&#8217;s meal would cost a different amount.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reason for choice:</strong> Although the above con can be a very real issue from a user&#8217;s standpoint, we believe this is the best balance between flexibility and usability.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 3</strong>: An expense is represented by a paying person, an amount, a list of paying people and the amount each person should pay back the paying person.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Ultimate flexibility and addresses the con above.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Significantly complicates the backend management of expenses. While this is something that will definitely be addressed in future versions of SplitWiser (e.g. adding a new <code>varexpense</code> command that enables this), we opted for a simpler version of <code>Expense</code> due to time constraints. The areas that need to be taken into consideration include (but may not limited to):</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Design of the command for the user in a way that is intuitive</p>

<h3 id="create-expense-feature"><a class="link" href="#create-expense-feature">Create expense feature</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The mechanism to create expenses is facilitated by <code>Expense</code>. Each <code>Activity</code> stores a list of <code>Expense</code> called <code>expenses</code>, representing the expenses incurred in the course of this activity.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When creating an expense, an amount and at least one person (the paying person) must be specified, and information about an expense cannot be modified once it is created. The only exception to this would be to delete an expense, but expenses also cannot be un-deleted once marked as deleted.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In terms of the name searching logic to actually identify who is involved, it is identical to that which is used in the creation of activities (see <a href="#Create activity feature">[Create activity feature]</a>), but with a few key differences:<br></p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>The expense will only be created if <strong>all</strong> sets of keywords result in a unique match. For instance, if the user specifies <code>p/John Doe p/Mary p/James</code>, but only the keyword <code>James</code> does not successfully identify a unique person, then the entire expense will not be created.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The search scope is contextual. If creating an expense outside an activity context, it will search for matches in the entire Address Book. However, in an activity context, it will only search for matches among existing activity participants.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here, it is important to realise that duplicating the name searching logic ensures a consistent user experience, as the user has no reason to expect that the search behaviour would be different. For example, if <code>john</code> was successfully used to identify a contact named <code>John Doe</code> when creating an activity, the user has no reason to expect that <code>john</code> would not be able to identify <code>John Doe</code> for an expense.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here is a sample use case in creating an expense:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Step 1.</strong> The user launches the application for the first time. The <code>SplitWiser</code> will be initialized with the initial address book and activity book state.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> The user executes <code>activity t/breakfast p/Jo p/Bob p/Alice</code> command to create an activity named breakfast with 3 participants added to the activity. The context is then switched to this new activity.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> The user executes <code>expense p/Jo e/10</code> to indicate that Jo paid $10 for something (unnamed as description is not specified) that is shared by everyone i.e. Bob and Alice. This happens because the default behaviour for <code>expense</code> is to assume everyone is involved if no one else is specified explicitly. <code>expense</code> command calls <code>Activity#addExpense()</code> and adds the new expense into the activity. The debt algorithm will then instantly recompute the debt matrix (see <a href="#Debt simplification algorithm">[Debt simplification algorithm]</a>) for the activity, and store the expense object inside the activity&#8217;s expense list (i.e. <code>expenses</code>).</p>
