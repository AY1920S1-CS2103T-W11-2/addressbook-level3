* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/ACTIVITY_NAME [p/PERSON_1]` can be used as `n/Drinks p/John Doe` or as `n/Drinks`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* (UNCONFIRMED, expense adding requires pairs of {p/ e/}) Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME hp/PHONE_NUMBER`, `hp/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

=== Add expenses to an activity : `expense`

Creates a new expense with a contact, amount and optional description, and adds it into the currently viewed activity. If no activity is being viewed, the description is compulsory and it will instead create a new activity with the same title as the description (as if `activity n/ACTIVITY_NAME` was called).
