== Summary of contributions
=== Major Enhancements
* *Activity Class*: I created the `Activity` class and all its dependencies.
** What it is: Activity class stores all information for an activity, such as `Title`, `Participants`, and `Expenses`.
** Justification: This feature is the foundation of our product. Activities contain all necessary information necessary to handle bill splitting.
** Highlights: Activities stores the following information:
*** Title: Title of the activity. Compulsory field.
*** Participants: Contacts that took part in this activity.
*** Expenses: Expenses incurred by this activity.

* *Storage of Activity*: I created the infrastructure that allows local storage of Activities.
** What it is: Activities can now be stored as a `ActivityBook.json` file locally, and loaded from there as well.
** Justification: Similar to how Contacts are stored locally, Activities should also be saved, so that it can be loaded the next time SplitWiser is opened. Without it, the program is unusable.
** Highlights: Activities are stored locally, and can be loaded anytime. Validations are executed on every load, preventing corrupted or invalid save files from being loaded.

* *Create Activity*: I added the ability to create Activities.
** What it does: The `Activity` command allows the user to create new activity.
** Justification: This is the foundational feature of our product. Activities contain all necessary information needed to handle splitting of bills, and we need to provide users the ability to create activities to make use of our product.
** Highlights: Activity command that allows users to create new activities. Users can specify the title of the activity, and can invite contacts into the activity as participants. In order to improve usability, contacts are first searched using exact-matching, and then keyword-based matching if no valid exact match is found.

* *Search functionality with context*: I added the ability to search using context.
** What it does: The `find` command allows the user to search based on current context. 
** Justification: This feature significantly increase the usability of our product. As time progresses, the application will have many contacts and activities, having the ability to find the one you want is invaluable.
** Highlights: Find command that searches based on the current context. When viewing a list of activities, find command searches for activity. When viewing a list of contacts, it searches for contacts instead. Uses keyword-based matching.
