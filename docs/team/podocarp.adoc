== PROJECT: Splitwiser

---

== Overview

Splitwiser is an application for simplifying payments made between groups of friends.
It gurantees that each person does not need to make any unnecessary transfers to settle their debts.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and is targeted at users who prefer CLI utilities.
It however has a nice JavaFX GUI to report details graphically and intuitvely.
It has >10k LOC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added the debt simplification algorithm.
** What it does: It simplifies all debts optimally in each activity.
** Justification: This is the core feature, and the main point of the entire application.
** Details: The algorithm scales well to huge amounts of participants and expenses, and can be mathematically proved to always minimize the money everyone has to touch in order to settle all debts in the group. https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-W11-2/main/pull/101[#101] 
** Credits: https://pure.tue.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/2062204/623903.pdf[This paper].

* *Major enhancement*: Update bindings for every command to mesh with the algorithm.
** Details: https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-W11-2/main/pull/119[#119] https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-W11-2/main/pull/120[#120] https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-W11-2/main/pull/110[#110] 

* *Major enhancement*: Added persistent internal state for primary key tracking.
** What it does: It keeps track of important variables across startups of the application.
** Justification: We require a unique identifier for every person and activity. This enables the tracking of who is in what activity easily. In essence, it is an ID for everthing. 
** Details: However this ID record for every object has to persist so that we don't end up assigning repeated IDs to different people/activities. We also need to perform validation on this data. https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-W11-2/main/pull/80[#80] https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-W11-2/main/pull/104[#104]

* *Minor enhancement*: added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.
** Details: https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-W11-2/main/pull/53[#53]
